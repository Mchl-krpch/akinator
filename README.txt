-----------------------------------------------

A simple clone game of the famous game akinator on the Internet [https://ru.akinator.com/]. Can guess your character from your Yes / No answers. The game has an uncomplicated lore and even its own character! You can take a look at your leisure. The program was written as part of the Dedinsky course.

   THE PROGRAM SHOULD SOLVE THE FOLLOWING PROBLEMS:
  
 - Be able to guess the envisioned character. This is implemented with a response tree. Akinator creates a
   tree that helps him get closer to the answer on each player's question.
   
 - Save player progress to hard drive. The player's progress is saved if he suddenly needs to leave the game
   and, for example, quickly worry about mathematical analysis for a semester test.
   
 - The program is similar to Akinator origin. She has her own game character and voiceover. character taken
   from the game "Sexy hiking" [https://gamin.me/games/sexy-hiking] - Great game-progenitor of the well-known
   game "getting over it" or otherwise known as the man in the cauldron.
   
   
   The release of all the textures for the game was done in the figma program - a simple interface editor that
   helped me make pictures for simple animations and splash screens. The plot of the game is similar to the
   lore of the classic game "Prince of Persia" published in 1984: you need to save the princess from the
   clutches of a greedy evil shah, who encroached on your beauty!
